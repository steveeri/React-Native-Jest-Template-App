React-Native-Jest-Template-App

This is simply a React-Native reference app for me that is configured to use Typescript instead of javascript, 
and is setup to use Jest... with tests also written in Typescript. 

There are a whole lot of installs required to get this working including a range of babel and jest configuration setting.
